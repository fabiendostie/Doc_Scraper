You can remove this line if you don’t need it or come back and add it if you are unable to sign in to your server on start up.To get the code go to https://plex.tv/claim and sign in, then put the code you receive after the ‘PLEX_CLAIM=’. You have 4 mins to finish the guide after doing this, so best to grab it just before running the project.\n\nIn this guide I am going to take you through the setup of Plex in Container Manager.\n\n### Does my Synology support Hardware Transcoding?\n\nBefore we do anything else, you should see if your model of Synology has hardware transcoding capabilities even if you don’t plan on using them at the moment! You need to do a quick lookup via the linked Google Sheet below, this is updated by Plex and makes it super easy to look up your model of NAS.\n\nIf you find that hardware transcoding is not available you can continue following the guide here, if it does support it, and you plan on buying a Plex Pass in the future follow the other guide from the menu.\n\n### Let’s Begin\n\nIn order to use this guide successfully you will need to complete the two preceding guides which will get your folder structure and Docker, user setup. In addition, if you already have the original Synology Plex Package installed you will need to uninstall it first.\n\n### Folder Setup\n\nLet’s start by getting some folders set up for the container to use. Open up File Station create the following.\n\n### Container Manager\n\nNext we are going to set up a ‘Project’ in Container Manager. Open up Container Manager and click on Project then on the right-hand side click ‘Create’.\n\nIn the next screen we will set up our General Settings, enter the following:\n\nNext we are going to drop in our docker compose configuration copy all the code in the box below and paste it into line ‘1’ just like the screenshot.\n\n### A note on Network Mode\n\nYou will notice that for Plex we don’t put it on the normal bridge network, this is because DSM reserves the DLNA ports Plex requires in order to use DLNA. So we run in Host mode, so it can share the ports.\n\n### Environment Variables\n\nWe need to make some changes in order for the container to have the correct permissions to save its configuration files  and to have access to your media.\n\n### Volumes\n\nI have pre-filled this section to pass the correct paths, the only thing that you may need to change is the /volume1/ if your file paths are on a different volume.\n\nClick ‘Next’\n\nYou do not need to enable anything on the ‘Web portal settings’ screen click ‘Next’ again.\n\nOn the final screen click ‘Done’ which will begin the download of the container images and once downloaded they will be launched!\n\nThe image will now be downloaded and extracted. You should see ‘Code 0’ when it has finished.\n\nYou will now see your Plex running and should have a green status on the left-hand side.\n\n### Firewall Exceptions\n\n#### (Skip if you don’t have the Firewall configured)\n\nIf you have the Synology Firewall enabled please seethis additional guidefor further info on exceptions and correct set up.\n\n### Port Forwarding\n\nIn order to use Plex remotely and stream your local media you need to forward port 32400 from your Router to the NAS IP on the same port. This varies for everyone’s router so check the manual on how to do this.\n\n### Initial Plex Setup\n\nAfter a few minutes you should be able to access the server and go through the Plex setup by going to the IP of your NAS in your browser followed by port 32400/web/\n\ne.g. 192.168.0.45:32400/web/\n\nYou will be asked to sign in or sign up for an account if you don’t have one already.\n\nYou should now be able to add your media which will be in the /data folder within Plex\n\nThat’s it you are all setup. When a new server update is available you will just need to restart the container, and it will automatically download the latest update.\n\n### Looking for some help, join our Discord community\n\nIf you are struggling with any steps in the  guides or looking to branch out into other containers join our Discord community!\n\n### Buy me a beverage!\n\nIf you have found my site useful please consider pinging me a tip as it helps cover the cost of running things or just lets me stay hydrated. Plus 10% goes to the devs of the apps I do guides for every year.\n\n- This great Google Sheet officially updated by Plex\n\n- Step 1: Directory Setup Guide\n\n- Step 2: Setting up a restricted Docker user",
